# LOgical Location REgression Network for Table Structure Recognition

The implementation of LORE (AAAI 2023).

LORE provides a hands-off way to apply an effective TSR model, by removing the effort for designing post-processings and decoding strategies. LORE captures dependencies and constraints between logical locations of cells, and predicts the logical locations along with the spatial locations.
